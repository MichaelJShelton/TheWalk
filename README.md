# TheWalk
This project is to create a multi-media content delivery app. This specific implementation uses this description for its intended purpose:

This is the Walk.
People are so busy these days with all kinds of life events. We need resources that work with our schedules. This is true for everything from education to entertainment. It is also true for our Spiritual lives as well. The Walk is a unique tool for people to develop a deeper relationship with Jesus and with others in community. Each episode is a journey to grow deeper with God. Each features multiple "Steps" that can be experienced individually or collectively. You can experience the Steps all at once, or separately spread out over multiple days - which ever works best for you.
Go on the Walk.
